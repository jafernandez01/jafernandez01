## 🌱 About me
I'm passionate about plant physiology, crop production, and applied statistics & programming. In my research, I'm keen on the intersection of plant physiology, crop production, and data analytics. I enjoy exploring how these fields can come together to create innovative solutions for agronomic and ecological research. I'm also passionate about promoting reproducibility and best practices in data analysis in these fields.

I'm currently engaged in the use of statistical, digital, and model technologies to assess crop growth and development, targeting crop adaptation, resource use efficiencies, and sustainability challenges of agricultural systems in Australia.

## 🤝 I’m Open for Collaborations
I'm open to collaborate on any related project combining plant physiology and data analytics for agronomic and ecological research. We also have multiple opportunities for agricultural and maths/IT/engineering students to enrol or be co-supervised in research with our teams. Get in touch for more details, my inbox is always open. I’ll try my best to get back to you!
