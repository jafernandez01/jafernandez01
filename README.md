## 🌱 About me
I'm passionate about plant physiology, crop production, and applied statistics & programming. In my research, I use statistical, digital, and model technologies to assess crop growth and development, targeting crop adaptation, resource use efficiencies, and sustainability challenges of agricultural systems in Australia. I enjoy exploring how these areas can come together to create innovative solutions for agronomic and ecological research, while promoting reproducibility and best practices in data analysis.

## 🤝 I’m Open for Collaborations
I'm open to collaborate on any related project combining plant physiology and data analytics for agronomic research. We also have multiple opportunities for agricultural and maths/IT/engineering students to enrol or be co-supervised in research with our teams. Get in touch for more details!
