# Hey, I'm Javier 👋
![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=jafernandez01&base=150&color=blueviolet)

I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at The University of Queensland, Australia.

## 🚀 About Me
I am strongly passionate about plant physiology, crop production, and applied statistics & programming. In my research, I investigate how past genetic improvement has modified resource capture and utilization in crop species. Mathematical models incorporates this knowledge to identify new opportunities for enhancing genetic gain and resilience to changing environmental conditions.

## 🌱 Interests

I have a keen interest in the intersection of plant physiology, crop production, and data analytics. I enjoy exploring how these fields can come together to create innovative solutions for agronomic and ecological research. I'm also passionate about promoting reproducibility and best practices in data analysis within these fields.

I am currently engaged in the use of statistical, digital, and model technologies to assess crop growth and development, with the overall goal of enhancing production, resource use efficiency, and sustainability of agricultural systems in Australia.

## 🤝 I’m Open for Collaborations
I'm looking to collaborate on any project combining plant physiology and data analytics for agronomic and ecological research. We also have multiple opportunities for agricultural and maths/IT/engineering students to enrol or be co-supervised in research with our teams. Get in touch for more details, my inbox is always open. I’ll try my best to get back to you!
